# SDSS-DR14-Classification-of-Stars-Galaxies-and-Quasars
Classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14

## Project Description
The focus of this project is to compare the performance of a traditional machine learning (ML) technique with the performance of a modern neural network (NN) to solve a classification problem. Using a real-world dataset from SDSS, we explore how to build the different the models and analyse the factors that influence the success of training. As raw optical images of the stars, galaxies and quasars in the survey can appear visably similar as 'point sources' on the sky, it can prove diffcult to calssify the type of object being observed. Therefore, the testing and implementation of ML and NN techniques on a dataset like SDSS DR14 can a provide quick and effective method for object classification. The results from the ML and NN models can be compared to the `class` column in the dataset to evaulte (and validate) the accuracy and limitations of each approach.

The project is structured into three main componets:
Q1. **Traditional Approach:** We apply a traditional machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree) to the dataset, explore how well the model performs and how its accuracy can be improved.
Q2. **Traditional vs. Neural Network Approach:** We build and apply a PyTorch neural network to the dataset, comparing its performance to the traditional machine learning model.
Q3. **Impact of Neural Network Factors:** We investigate how different factors (such as pre-training, batch sizes and epochs) affect the performance of the neural network.

### Key Objectives:
- **Comparison of Algorithms:** Compare a traditional machine learning approach (Decision Tree) with a neural network to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach.
- **Neural Network Performance:** Explore how data handling and hyperparameters affect the performance of a neural network.
- **Research Investigation:** Address a research question for to neural network optimisation: *How does pre-training (and epochs and batches) affect the performance of a neural network?*

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models.
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch for building the neural networks.
- **Data Science:** Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation; Matplotlib for data visualisation.
- **Python Dependencies:** A list of dependencies is provided in the `dependencies.txt` file.

The project includes detailed tutorials for beginners (Q1 & Q2) and more advanced discussions for intermediate users (Q3), with a focus on addressing the reshearch question for NN optimisation.

## Dataset Overview
This project provides a detailed exploration of astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14). The dataset consists of **10,000** observations of taken from the fourth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV). Each observation is described by **17 feature columns** and **1 target column** that identifies the observation as being a **star**, **galaxy**, or **quasar**. The catalog includes object position in the sky (`ra` and `dec`), redshift (`z`) and the observed apparent magnitudes in each filter band, each are crital parameters to training the ML or NN classifiers.

- The dataset includes observed magnitudes for the objects across multiple filter bands (`u`, `g`, `r`, `i`, `z`) and metadata for spectroscopic observations with corresponding redshift values.
- Objects are also classified as either **STAR**, **GALAXY** or **QSO** which is the target column the ML and NN models are testest against.

### Why Traditional Approaches?
Machine learning has evolved dramatically in recent years, and neural networks have become the go-to solution for many computationlly complex problems. However, traditional machine learning algorithms still have their place, especially when dealing with smaller datasets or problems that donâ€™t require the complexity of deep learning models. In this project, we begin by applying a simple ('easy-to-implement') traditional machine learning method (Desicion Tree) to solve a classification problem. The goal is to establish how well can the traditional method handles the data, and what kind of performance can be expected from a simple model. We also examine the ease of implementation, interpretability, and speed of these models, which remain essential factors in certain scenarios.

### Why Neural Networks?
Neural networks today are critical in AI, image recognition and language processing. However, they are often require much more expertise to implement as well more training data and computational power to achieve optimal performance. The motivation for including a neural network in this project is to explore how well these models perform compared to traditional methods when solving the same classification problem. We are particularly interested in understanding how neural networks can overcome limitations that traditional approaches might struggle with, such as non-linear relationships, complex feature interactions, scalability. We also investigate the impact of various factors of neural network architecture (Q3) on model performance.
